# ReactTodoodily
<b> Todo application with MERN stack </b>

This is a single-page application built with Reactjs and running on a Node server. 

The app will display a form for submission of new todo items. The existing todo items are displayed in a list. From the list view it is possible to mark todos as done, to update their title or description and to remove them. The drag & drop functionality allows for persistent reordering of individual items in the list. 

The todos and their order are saved in MongoDB.
